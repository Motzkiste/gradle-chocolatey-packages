    <summary>Gradle is a modern open source polyglot build automation system. It can automate and integrate your devOps toolchain with a concise and expressive build programming language based upon the concepts of Apache Ant and Apache Maven.</summary>
    <description>Gradle combines the power and flexibility of Apache Ant with the dependency management and conventions of Apache Maven into a more effective way to build. Powered by a Groovy DSL and packed with innovation, Gradle provides a declarative way to describe all kinds of builds through sensible defaults. Gradle is quickly becoming the build system of choice for many open source projects, leading edge enterprises and legacy automation challenges.

Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. If you are building, testing, publishing, and deploying software on any platform, Gradle offers a flexible model that can support the entire development lifecycle from compiling and packaging code to publishing web sites. Gradle has been designed to support build automation across multiple languages and platforms including Java, Scala, Android, C/C++, and Groovy, and is closely integrated with development tools and continuous integration servers including Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Jenkins.

    <releaseNotes>This bug-fix release addresses 3 regressions in Gradle 4.3.

Gradle 4.3 introduced an change where an error in resolving a module from one repository would prevent Gradle from searching for that same module in subsequent repositories.

However, the change to abort searching repositories on all unrecognized errors proved to be too aggressive. With 4.3.1, only repository timeout errors will prevent Gradle from searching for a module in a subsequent repository.

Moreover, the connection and socket timeouts for HTTP/HTTPS requests have been increased to 30 seconds.

This version of Gradle also removes an overload of TaskInputs.property which caused statically compiled plugin code to use the wrong method when calling TaskInputs.property(..., null).

Finally, when using --scan the build scan plugin is applied before other plugins to avoid rendering a warning message.
