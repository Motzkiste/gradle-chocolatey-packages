    <summary>Gradle is a modern open source polyglot build automation system. It can automate and integrate your devOps toolchain with a concise and expressive build programming language based upon the concepts of Apache Ant and Apache Maven.</summary>
    <description>Gradle combines the power and flexibility of Apache Ant with the dependency management and conventions of Apache Maven into a more effective way to build. Powered by a Groovy DSL and packed with innovation, Gradle provides a declarative way to describe all kinds of builds through sensible defaults. Gradle is quickly becoming the build system of choice for many open source projects, leading edge enterprises and legacy automation challenges.

Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. If you are building, testing, publishing, and deploying software on any platform, Gradle offers a flexible model that can support the entire development lifecycle from compiling and packaging code to publishing web sites. Gradle has been designed to support build automation across multiple languages and platforms including Java, Scala, Android, C/C++, and Groovy, and is closely integrated with development tools and continuous integration servers including Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Jenkins.

    <releaseNotes>The Gradle team is pleased to announce Gradle 3.1.

Multi-project builds are a powerful feature with one significant constraint: the projects have to be in the same directory hierarchy. This doesn't help if you want to work on code across multiple repositories, for example if you're trying to fix a bug in a third-party open-source library that one of your projects depends on.
